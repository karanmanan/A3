									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>The project idea is ‘Sports Hub’, an all-in-one app that users can use to view whether public sporting areas are open, users can view sporting scores, get video lessons, and find upcoming local tournaments. <br><br>
										The app will be able to be downloaded from the Play Store and also the App Store, allowing for variability in the user access.<br><br>
										The focal point of the app will be viewing if the public sporting area is being occupied or not. The user will be able to access courts, fields, and ovals, covering sports such as tennis, soccer, football, basketball. This is to reduce the stress and time wasted in finding somewhere to enjoy playing sports.<br><br>
										The user will also be able to connect with coaches through the app if they wish to get 1-on-1 coaching to assist them in improving their game.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<p>This app is designed for the sports lovers, as in Australia more than 90% of adults have an interest in sports. This app is focusing on sports like Basketball, cricket, Football, Tennis and Soccer as these are the most popular sports in Australia also these sports are also the most widely recognised sports throughout the globe.</p>
									<p>The app will also be able to identify talent as users must input the game results after the game, and then the player will be ranked by scores and location. This will also help to locate the talent in the country. We can also notify the concerned parties (CA, NBL, AFC) about the top 10 players in our database after every sport season through our automatic email generated system.</p>
									<p>This is also the best learning platform, as if players want to improve their game or want to learn basics about the other games that they are interested in they just need to book one-on-one appointments with the coaches available on the application; they can also book appointments with coaches to play with the team as a beginner.</p>
									<p>Players can also make their own team by contacting the other player through the app, this is one of the best features on our app because if top 10 players want to make their own team improve their skills and techniques, they can do that by using our app, this can also give Australia their next top-echelon players. They can also choose their locations for practice based on everyone’s availability and location using our app. </p>
									<p>In the near future we are also planning to add one more feature for our best player, which is that once in a year they can meet Australian national Players of each sport field. We will invite them to our local clubs to meet our top players and discuss with them what our next players should do, to share about their exercise and diet plans and guide them on the right path. This feature will motivate the players and it will also attract other players to join our app.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>Sports Hub is an application that assists people in finding various public sporting areas. The type of areas it will include will be, football ovals, soccer pitches, tennis courts and basketball courts. The app’s aim is to promote the use of public sporting areas and get people to socialise through a common interest in sports.</p>
									<p>Once the app has been downloaded, the app will require a form of login to utilise the full functionality of the app. Details that will be required will be, name, age and their sporting level, the app will also require location access so it will have an easier time to locate the closest sporting areas. Having the login will also ensure that the user’s details are kept, and their history will be kept. They’ll also be able to favourite their most preferred court, so they can 		see whether their favourite court is being occupied. When selecting a place to play the app will also show the user the directions towards the area so there won’t be any issues with locating the place.</p>
									<p>The app will have functionality to check whether the court has been occupied by another user, this will reduce the time that is required to find a free public court. With this the user will also be able to connect with other users if they wish to test their skills and have a match with someone, or simply to have someone to play with.</p>
									<p>The user will also be able to view their favourite sport scores from the latest matches, covering the sports that the app covers. This way it keeps the sports unique to the app and what the app can offer to the user. Not only will it show scores from professional sports, but the user will also be able to locate local tournaments which other users and moderators would have posted onto the app. </p>
									<p>In locating local tournaments, users will also be able to create their own tournament. This can be done by inputting the number of teams that will be participating and if they wish the team can also input the team member names.</p>
									<p>Another function that the app will have will be selecting the type of area they want to play on. For sports like soccer and tennis especially where the type of flooring can vary depending on the area. In terms of soccer, the user may wish to play on synthetic grass over regular grass or if there is only synthetic grass nearby it will also display the type of flooring when selecting the place.
										Adding the option to meet with verified coaches through the app will be something incorporated if the user wishes to also expand on their gameplay and have some guidance.</p>
									<p>Also, functionality for users to locate any sporting goods they need from recognised sporting retailers will be something that users will be able to utilise. However, these functions will not be a huge focus of the app and aimed towards a small portion of users.

											<h3 class="major">Tools + Tech</h3>
											<p>Since sports hub is going to be a mobile friendly app we need to use a software that excels on creating mobile apps, Appy Pie, Zoho Creator, AppSheet and Appian are all great softwares to create the user interface. <br><br>
												To get some of the functions to work like the GPS we will need to use trilateration which is a tool that allows us to find your position on Earth once the location of GPS satellites orbiting the Earth and their distance from your location. We also need an API (application programming interface) to be able to access messages, videos and records, since an API allows two apps to connect with one another to retrieve data from the other source like a back and forth method. <br><br> Programming languages required we might need to use are Java script, Kotlin, Swift and Python.

											<h3 class="major">Skills</h3>
											<p>To create an app that is accessible to both android and ios users, we need a thorough understanding of ” Java”, and “Objective-C” and” Swift” for iOS app development. There are many options to choose from when picking a software to create an android app, for example, android studio, Appery.io, Appy Pie, Game Salad, etc.  For an iOS app however,  you need a Mac computer with the latest version of Apple’s IDE called “Xcode”.<br><br>
												Aside from efficient coding in many languages, good design, writing skills, data expertise and integrity and security of data is also crucial in order to develop a trustworthy and reliable app. Familiarity with Cloud Infrastructure is must for mobile app developers. The programming team should be skilled in utilising cloud technologies like Amazon Web services, GitHub, Microsoft Azure, etc. These platforms allow the developers to have access to a global network of data centers to store their application infrastructure.<br><br>
													<hX>Overall, the most important skills in order to develop a mobile app are:</hX>
														<ul>
															<li>Proficiency in coding languages like Java, Objective-C and Swift</li>
															<li>Good design, writing and security measures</li>
															<li>Skilled use of cloud platforms and IDEs</li>
														</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Outcome</h3>
									<p>If the project is successful, we will have two Apps one on Google Play Store and one on the App Store that help people find sporting fields, nets, courts and ovals via user input in real time relative to the location a user is enquiring about .  This development will hopefully help people find a game, a place to practice or even someone to coach them and reduce people going somewhere that is already being occupied.</p>
