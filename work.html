											<h3 class="major">Background Information about IT Professional</h3>
											<p>Name is Zubair Aslam and he has been working in the IT field for 20 years and is the lead solution engineer for Salesforce.
											</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
											<p>I'm working in the solution engineering department in Salesforce. Our work essentially is to make sure that we understand the client’s business requirement and then propose an appropriate solution which both meets their business requirements but also takes care of their budgetary and time constraints.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
											<p>We work across multiple industries including public sector healthcare retail oil and gas, but my primary focus is healthcare so I'm trying to be across what is happening in the healthcare industry and most of my clients are from the same industry.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
											<p>My work includes a variety of tasks throughout the sales cycle. So, starting from a discovery phase, we will try to understand the business requirement and then map it onto us as the appropriate solution, then propose a bill of criteria which includes, what products are required and what services are required to be delivered as the solution. <br>
												Sometimes it also involves doing the product demonstration or doing a proof of concept and then finally if the sales happen then we also provide post service support to their appropriate services team.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h3>
											<p>Our work involves very close collaboration with a variety of teams, both within Salesforce and with our client sites as well. <br>
												Within Salesforce our team is a very cross functional team which include an account executive who's really responsible for the end to end life cycle of a sale and also post-sales. Many other people including a solution architect, a client, a success architect, as well as supporting that might be later on. Similarly, on the client side we sometimes talk to the architects of the client side, some security guards, network guys and also some business people are also involved during all this discussion.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
											<p>Our interaction with other team members can really be of two types. One is more logistics, like agreeing on what to deliver and how to deliver, what the sources we need and what are the ways of working. <br>
												Second, is actually doing the job and interacting with the right people to deliver what is agreed to be delivered. This could involve having some architecture level discussions all the way to having some very deep technical discussions with the product team.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
											<p>Our job really doesn't involve talking to investors. We have a separate function within the organisation which is more to do with the investor relations. Even if we get some questions by a client which are more related to the investment priorities we refer them to that dedicated department, but when it comes to talking to the clients this is I think 70% of our job is to talk to the customers.<br>
												 These are as it said before, really trying to understand what they're trying to do before telling them what we do to solve their problems. So, it's really understanding what they are trying to achieve within their organisation and then telling them how we can help them do what they are trying to do.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
											<p>There are primarily two activities that we spend most of our time on. One is what we call discovery and this is where we talk to the customer and we try to really understand the landscape with the customer, problems that they are having and how to solve those problems. <br><br>
												The second phase is really then to come back and map it onto our product set. This is where we spend a lot of time understanding our own products and then how they map onto the client requirements and in this phase we also sometimes go back to the customer to do the product demonstration, sometimes the customer if they really want to see things working we can also do a proof of concepts. <br><br>
												So these are really two phases if I have to say that way and one is to discover and the second is to deliver.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
											<p>Interestingly the aspect of my job that I find the most challenging is also the one that I enjoy the most as well. This is really understanding the clients requirement and when we are talking about our company, just making sure that we're not just talking about why Salesforce is an awesome company, rather talking at customer language and making sure that whatever features and aspects of our company and products we're talking about, they really make sense for the customer. <br><br>
											It's also talking customer language is really the way to become a trusted advisor from a customer and once you win their trust, that's where their relationship really becomes different and client is more open to discuss ideas and that also provide us an opportunity to talk to them more about what Salesforce is doing that can really help them grow their business.</p>
										</article>

										<article>
											<h3 class="major">Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
											<p>Well you have saved the best question for last. So, I think that's a very interesting question and to answer the question I would like you to think the function of IT has really changed over the period of the last ten years or so. <br><br>
												IT was more considered as a support function within any organisations or just to make sure computers are working and the software is working and it has really changed to become more often than enabler for any business. <br><br>
												Take the example of COVID and the pandemic that we are living in, all your sales and our go services and everything is really done by the digital channels. <br><br>
												So, IT is not only just making sure that the things are working, but it's really providing you that opportunity to sell in a whole really different way. <br><br>
												So, even your product managers and different functions within any industry, they’re really reliant on IT to make sure that the business is really running and this is where I think our job has become really important. We're not just ‘techies’ sitting on our computers the whole day, but we're really trying to understand what is happening in the business and how is IT going to make sure that the business is really delivering and is competitive when it comes to the competition that we see today in the market.</p>
